The examples in this directory implement M-2M ladders of arbitrary
length - albeit real-world practical applications are probably
non-existant after 5-6 stages, they are here used to check no time
regression are present in the EKV implementation.

A description of the M-2M ladder may be found in:

current division technique,” *IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits*,
